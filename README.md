# 𓅂 Crow

> A fast, offline-first, dark-themed API client built with Tauri — for developers who prefer silence, speed, and full control.

Crow is a lightweight Postman alternative designed for hackers, villains, and API snipers. It loads instantly, works offline, stores everything locally, and never phones home. No cloud sync. No bloat. Just you, the terminal, and your requests.
